# Social Media Based Library App

This application is my thesis project. The starting point of the project is as follows; <br> ***I love reading books. After reading the book, I write summaries and notes. There is no app that can do this. That's why I keep all these notes in my [myLibrary](https://github.com/ufukcankurt/myLibrary) repo on github... Considering all this, I decided to turn it into an application.***
